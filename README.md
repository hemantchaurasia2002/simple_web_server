# simple_web_server
A simple web server is a software application or program that serves as the backbone of the World Wide Web.
A simple web server in Golang is a straightforward implementation of a web server using the Go programming language. Go, often referred to as Golang, is known for its simplicity and efficiency. In this context, a simple web server in Golang would typically include the following basic components and functionalities:

HTTP Server: It uses Go's standard net/http package to create an HTTP server. This package provides essential tools for handling HTTP requests and responses.

Routing: The server defines routes to handle specific HTTP endpoints (e.g., URL paths) by using the http.HandleFunc function to map URLs to corresponding request handlers.

Request Handling: HTTP requests (GET, POST, etc.) are processed by associated handler functions, which generate appropriate HTTP responses, such as serving static files or generating dynamic content.

Static File Serving: You can serve static files like HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and images by specifying a directory for serving these resources using the http.FileServer function.

Port Configuration: The server listens on a specified port (e.g., port 80 or 8080) to accept incoming HTTP requests.
